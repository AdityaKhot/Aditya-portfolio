While delivery apps exist, current grocery applications don’t take into account \r\n                local markets, and thus homebound individuals are unable to access their products.</p>\r\n            \r\n            <h2>Research</h2>\r\n            <p>We did a combination of primary and secondary research on three stakeholders– the customer, the service provider, and \r\n                the business owner– to gain a deeper understanding of the user needs and pain points.</p>\r\n                <p>To gain the customer’s perspective, we used semi-structured interviews and observed customers at local grocery stores in\r\n                 Pittsburgh, such as Seoul Mart and Bombay Food Market. We also interviewed the store owner on their thoughts on adding \r\n                 delivery services. We also conducted secondary research through browsing on forums (Reddit) for all three stakeholders. </p>\r\n                 \r\n                 <p>Based on our findings, we created a persona for the customer (grocery shoppers), service provider (delivery person), and business owner. </p>\r\n\r\n                <div className=\"persona\">\r\n                    <img src={customer} alt = \"persona of a customer\"/>\r\n                    <p><strong>Customer: Susan Smith</strong><br/>Susan is an elderly woman who used to regularly go grocery shopping, but has now turned to online groceries due \r\n                        to exhaustion and leg pains.

One idea was about \"bundles,\" which would contain multiple items that, \r\n                when combined, could create a complete dish. We used these storyboards in a 'speed dating' exercise with potential \r\n                customers to help us gauge if any of our ideas resonated with our users. Our aim was to make shopping decisions easier for \r\n                customers and also offer a platform for business owners to showcase their products.</p>\r\n\r\n            <img src = {storyboard} alt = \"one of the storyboards created with the concept of bundles-- Maya is a business owner of a new local grocery store. Recently, she has been trying to create new ways to increase business and get more customers at her store. Using a new grocery app, she can put items in bundles. This puts ingredients that go together (ex: tomato sauce and pasta) to entice customers to order them together. Customers can order items and get them delivered with the help of service providers. The added convenience of bundles helps them remember to buy certain items for specific recipes.\"></img>\r\n\r\n               <p> Participants responded positively to the bundle concept. They particularly liked the idea of specialized bundles such as a \r\n                \"get well soon\" pack for the sick and elderly. We also realized that our bundles could go beyond just food items. \r\n                For example, including recipes would not only provide added value but also foster a sense of community among our users. </p>\r\n\r\n                <h2>User Flow</h2>\r\n                <p>Based on these insights, we developed a user flow of how our users would interact with our product.</p> \r\n\r\n<img src = {userflow} alt = \"user flow diagram for the customer, service provider, and business owner\"></img>\r\n\r\n            {/* <h2>Screen Maps</h2>   \r\n            <p>We ideated screens specific to each of the three key stakeholders.</p>\r\n            <p>For the <strong>customer</strong>, understanding that many often switch between devices when ordering groceries, we designed an integrated experience across both mobile and desktop platforms.</p>\r\n            <p>For the <strong>service provider</strong>, given their on-the-move nature, we used a mobile-first approach, crafting screens optimized for quick access and ease of use while on the go.</p>\r\n            <p>For the <strong>business owner</strong>, who primarily focuses on in-depth data and store analytics, we designed comprehensive desktop screens.
