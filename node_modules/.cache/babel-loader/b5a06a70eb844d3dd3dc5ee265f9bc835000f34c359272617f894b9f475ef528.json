I focused on ensuring consistency in user flow and design vision throughout iterations. This project was especially valuable to me because\r\n                I had the opportunity to take on both the role of a designer and a developer, which gave me insights \r\n                into both the design and technical aspects of creating an app. I really enjoyed this dual-role experience-- I got to\r\n                understand how my designs would translate into the development side, and it also improved my technical proficiency in Swift/XCode and \r\n                collaboration through GitHub.</p>\r\n\r\n            <h3>Navigating Limits</h3>\r\n            <p>As we began coding out the app, I discovered that many design decisions I made in our prototype were not entirely feasible \r\n                due to iOS and Swift/Xcode limitations or because of time constraints. We ended up having to adapt and change our initial \r\n                plans for our features during the development process. This experience underscored the importance of understanding \r\n                technical limitations early in the design process, and I am sure to keep in mind the technology and structural elements when designing \r\n                for development in the future.</p>\r\n\r\n            <h3>Feature Prioritization</h3>\r\n            <p>In the face of technical challenges, especially concerning the camera feedback function, our team underwent a critical exercise of feature prioritization. \r\n                We had a lot of ideas in the beginning, but it became evident that some were either too time-consuming to \r\n                implement or did not align with our core objectives. This process of narrowing down the feature list was a \r\n                valuable lesson in focusing on essentials.</p>\r\n        </div>\r\n\r\n
